# Development-of-Embedded-and-Real-Time-Systems-DIT632
The course is a part of the Software Engineering and Management program at Gothenburg University and Chalmers University of Technology.

Embedded and real-time software is often closely interacting with hardware. Typically, this software is written in a language like C on either a real-time operating system or a stripped Unix/Linux version. The course contains an introduction to general operating systems and real-time operating systems, an introduction to programming for an embedded environment and tools used to develop embedded systems. New concepts, mainly, used in the real-time and embedded systems will be introduced.
